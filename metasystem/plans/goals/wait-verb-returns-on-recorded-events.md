# wait-verb-returns-on-recorded-events

- State: queued
- Risk: severity=2 novelty=2 exposure=3 accumulation=2 basis="severity 2: a wait that never returns idles a seat, a wait that returns early spends a model turn; novelty 2: a wait verb over the existing job, run, attempt and ledger records is new, the records are not; exposure 3: every seat's waiting; accumulation 2: the waiter record, the four source readers, the adapter answer and the verbs"
- Tier: 2
- Intent: Member 1 of coordinator-wakes-on-events-not-polls (its design page plans/coordinator-wakes-on-events-not-polls-design.md, sections 2, 5 and 6). DONE means: the installed commands metasystem wait --job, --run, --attempt and --goal (landing and human-act, the answer wait keyed by question and taking its cursor from the question record) return on the recorded event or the bounded deadline with the typed exits of section 2; every adapter's wait-delivery operation answers blocking and the row records it, so no temporary fallback is needed; the version-2 waiter row and its by-id pointer exist; a restart recovers from the rows alone through --resume, with session start printing the WAITING commands where a start hook exists. This member owns the parent's DONE clauses 1 and 4 and clause 2's adapter operation. Fixtures: TestWaitJobTerminals, TestWaitRunTerminalsAndDeadline, TestWaitAdapterBlocking, TestWaitAttemptRequiresCommittedTerminal, TestWaitAttemptAfterDrain, TestWaitGoalLandingAndHumanAct, TestWaitGoalCursorHistory, TestWaitChannelAnswer, TestWaitRestartRecoveryReplay, TestWaitLockClockAndFetchBounds, TestWaitGoalFetchDeadline; bed legs wait-job-run, wait-proof, wait-ledger, wait-restart, wait-bounds.
- Origin: main
- Next step: m1b briefs the Codex sol build in a worktree (plans/wait-verb-returns-on-recorded-events-build-brief.md); the seat proves each round with job prove-round, Opus reads at DESIGN-BEARING, a human commit.
