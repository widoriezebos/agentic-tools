# delegate-job-liveness

- State: claimed
- Intent: The live delegation lane comes back under metasystem custody, and delegated worker status must not lie. Evidence through 2026-08-27: at least six zombie/launch failures in two days — status fields raced or lied in four sightings 2026-08-26/27, then the correction pass for actionable-metrics double-fired at launch (a >10min first call retried, minting a duplicate resume whose id was handed back while the real task ran under another) and later zombied (status running 15+min after log, work products, and process were all dead; caught only by a coordinator's hand-rolled monitor applying the work-product-mtime + process-probe + timed-verdict triad). Root cause: the fleet's real lane (codex companion, raw codex exec) runs outside the job-record machinery entirely — no job record since 2026-08-12, no process identity, no idempotent launch, no cap, no reaper. Every protection exists in the metasystem dispatch lane and none of it applies to the lane in daily use (Wido approved this arc re-scope 2026-08-27)
- Origin: human
- Next step: HIGH PRIORITY, CLAIMED m1, BUILD RUNNING CONTINUOUSLY. POSITION 2026-08-28 ~01:45: STAGES 1-3 COMPLETE and coordinator-verified (identity core after two correction cycles — binary-skew rebuild-before-copy, fake-seam authorization with kernel-death veto, tagged-hold shape, suite exit honesty; claim verb with golden-vector v1 fingerprint, green first try; session occupancy index with both crash orders, green first try). STAGE 4 (group custody) built + two ADJUDICATIONS folded (instanceTag = reservation identity; custody-death requires a group while pid-less records flow to the reaper's non-death arms and the reconciliation engine — all three reap surfaces unified). THIRD correction IN FLIGHT: the real machine exposed a design flaw — absence-requires-zero-unknowns counted 302 foreign macOS processes, making creator-abandonment unprovable on any real host; the fix narrows the candidate universe to our-uid signalable processes per the survivors.go indeterminacy precedent (foreign EPERM processes neither match nor block; same-user unreadables still defer). On double-green: stage 5 (product signals), stage 6 (call-site migration + critique-round routing), code-critique chain, land. Doc edit (never-stop doctrine in orchestration.md) rides the landing window. My pipeline-rc verification mistake owned and corrected (direct rc capture everywhere).
