# stop-decisions-record-deadline-evidence

- State: queued
- Risk: severity=2 novelty=3 exposure=3 accumulation=2 basis="severity 2: a refusal emitted without a durable decision behind it can neither be audited nor drained, and a decision recorded twice per deadline double-counts an incident; novelty 3: a version-2 stop decision record shared by the hook, its deadline parent and the steward is a new durable format with a new identity (turn generation plus deadline end); exposure 3: every stop of every seat; accumulation 2: the record is read by the steward's drain (member stop-incidents-reach-the-steward) and by the seven-day count"
- Tier: 3
- Intent: Member 2 of stop-hook-never-forces-an-empty-turn (its design page, section 7; this member's page plans/stop-decisions-record-deadline-evidence-design.md): each emitted refusal has a prior durable decision with its full up result and the checkout generation, and each incident episode is keyed to the hook's turn generation and deadline end, so the deadline parent and the worker never record the same stop twice and a later drain can tell episodes apart. DONE means: (1) the stop decision record (version 2) is written before any refusal or degraded notice is emitted, carrying the class, cause, component, the full up result as up prints it, the checkout's enrollment generation, the turn generation and the deadline end; (2) an episode is keyed by turn generation and deadline end, and the deadline parent's completion of a worker's decision is single-use: a second completion for the same key changes nothing and says so; (3) an emission whose decision could not be written is itself recorded in the hook log with the write failure and the notice says it; (4) TestArmingDetailSurvivesStop keeps passing: the arming detail reaches the notice byte for byte from the record. Fixtures: TestInfrastructureDeadlineIdentity, TestStopDecisionPersistsBeforeEmission, TestStopDeadlineCompletionIsSingleUse, TestArmingDetailSurvivesStop.
- Origin: main
- Next step: m1b lands the design page (drafted), one rostered Codex sol design read at DESIGN-BEARING, then a Codex sol build in a worktree, an Opus read, a human commit.
