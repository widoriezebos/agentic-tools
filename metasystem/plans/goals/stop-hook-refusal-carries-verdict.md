# stop-hook-refusal-carries-verdict

- State: queued
- Risk: severity=2 novelty=2 exposure=3 accumulation=2 basis="The stop hook runs at every turn end on every machine; its plan-work refusal drops the one-line health verdict and the open-work display the design promises, and its deadline path replaces a finished answer with a timeout sentence; each wrong refusal costs the human a re-prompt."
- Tier: 3
- Intent: scripts/agents/supervision-hook.sh: since the stop-hook fix (6e0221e0) the 'Work named in a plan is unblocked' refusal returns a block whose reason carries neither the goal-thread verdict display (OPEN WORK (1) naming the open step; design points GOAL-04/05, byte-identity) nor the one-line HEALTH verdict, and the deadline parent appends 'Metasystem Stop deadline expired before a safe turn verdict' even when the worker answered in time; Wido saw exactly this refusal on the m2 console on 2026-09-04. The supervision fixture's stop-hook-monitor scenario pins the lawful shape and is red; three rounds of chain sse-build1 (preserved on preserve/sse-build1-r3: the evidence path moved to the steward component record, a deadline-preservation change, and a reworked block composition that regressed the health line) did not get it green. DONE means every block the hook emits carries the verdict display first, then any rule sentence, with the HEALTH verdict in the system message; the deadline sentence appears only when the deadline actually expired; and the stop-hook-monitor scenario passes on a Mac.
- Origin: main
- Next step: One hook composition fix with the scenario as its test: build from preserve/sse-build1-r3, run supervision-fixtures.sh seat-side, land through a chain. Tier from the risk basis; waits for Wido's word if above tier 1.
