# codex-handshake-budget-load-fragile

- State: queued
- Intent: The Codex adapter's session handshake budget is a hard-coded 10 seconds (scripts/agents/adapters/codex.sh line 71, declared into the capability snapshot as sessionEstablishedTimeoutSec and consumed by the dispatch supervisor), and on 2026-09-02 a direct probe on m1 measured 14 seconds from launch to Codex's thread.started event at load average 6, so every Codex dispatch on m1 failed with handshake_timeout by construction (jobs breach-design-crit2 and breach-design-crit2b, two goal attempts spent, the highest-priority breach-clock chain blocked). The child was alive and healthy the whole time; the cap converted slowness into failure, which R-35-m3 names a defect: patience must be progress-based (the child is alive and has not exited) with the fixed number only as a hang bound. No lawful override exists: the snapshot is immutable evidence and the value has no config key.
- Origin: main
- Next step:  MEASURED 2026-09-02 15:20 on m1 after the machine was healed (fseventsd restarted, 488 leaked fixture processes and 996 stale beds removed, load under 5): codex-cli 0.148.0 still takes 18 seconds from launch to thread.started, so the 10-second cap fails on a healthy m1 too; the cause is Codex's own cold start on this host, not load. The VM seats, where Codex dispatches succeed, are the comparison point for the design.
